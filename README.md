# Cat-Weather-App

This project is a cat-themed weather App. 

It uses an API to pull real-time weather data for any location. The data then gets displayed to the user through a GUI. The program displays information about the short forecast (a quick description of the weather), the probability of precipitation, the wind speed and direction, the long forecast (a detailed description of the weather), a 3-, 5-, or 7-day forecast, and the date and time. All of this information is not displayed on just one screen. 

The GUI features five different screens: the Main screen (where the user starts), the More Information screen, the 3-Day Forecast screen, the 5-Day Forecast screen, and the 6-Day Forecast screen. Each screen is able to go back to the previous screen (meaning there are no dead ends and the user cannot get stuck on any screen). The main screen has access to the other 4 screens. 

Each screen displays information dedicated to it and features custom artwork. Each screen shows a cat themed around the current weather conditions; if the weather changes, so do the cats. All the images are designed to tell the user what the conditions are outside at a quick glance. 

This project incorporates many elements of JavaFX to create the GUIs and give them the required functionality. The API was designed and implemented by Professor McCarty, and the GUI design and program were designed and implemented by Ashley Daly.
